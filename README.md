MPED: A Multi-Modal Physiological Emotion Database for Discrete Emotion
Abstract
To explore human emotions, we design and build a multi-modal physiological emotion database, which collects four modal physiological signals, i.e., electroencephalogram (EEG), galvanic skin response, respiration, and electrocardiogram (ECG). To alleviate the influence of culture dependent elicitation materials and evoke desired human emotions, we specifically collect an emotion elicitation material database selected from more than 1500 video clips. By the considerable amount of strict man-made labeling, we elaborately choose 28 videos as standardized elicitation samples, which are assessed by psychological methods. The physiological signals of participants were synchronously recorded when they watched these standardized video clips that described six discrete emotions and neutral emotion.
